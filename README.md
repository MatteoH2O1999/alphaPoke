## Installation
The software does not require an installation process.
Download the correct file from the [release](https://github.com/MatteoH2O1999/alphaPoke/releases) section.
How to start it depends on your OS:

### Windows
Just download and open `alphaPoke_win.exe`.

Your browser will probably tell you that the file cannot be trusted.
Most browsers just give you the option to download anyway.

When you start it for the first time `Windows SmartScreen` will probably pop out.
Just click on `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

### MacOS
Download `alphaPoke_macOS.zip` and unpack it.
Inside there is the app ready to go.
MacOS will probably tell you that the app is from an untrusted source.
To open it anyway just right-click it and click on `open`.

### Linux
Download `alphaPoke_linux` and put it where you want.
Then add the executable bit to the file with `chmod +x path/to/executable`. 
At this point you can start it with `path/to/executable`.
